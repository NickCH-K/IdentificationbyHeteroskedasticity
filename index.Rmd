This repository contains brief blog-like thoughts, usually on econometrics. And let's be honest, it's only a matter of time before it's abandoned. My name is Nick Huntington-Klein, and I am an assistant professor of economics at Seattle University. 

You can find more about me [here](https://www.nickchk.com). You can also check out more of my writing via my causal inference textbook [The Effect](https://www.theeffectbook.net) which you should totally buy or at least read the free version I just linked.

Say hello to the skewed dude. He's okay about being here.
